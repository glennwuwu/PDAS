## PDAS
Singapore Polytechnic Year 1 Semester 2 "Programming for Data Analytics" Module Final Assignment

# Introduction
The goal of this project was to come up with an area of focus relating to the **environment** and use data wrangling, cleansing, and analysis techniques to gain an insight into this area using relevant datasets. I chose to focus Singapore's historical weather trends as well as its relation to Singapore's electrical grid's peak system demand.
